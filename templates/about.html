    <h3>Thank you for checking this website!❤️</h3>
    <p>This app is born out of my love for road cycling and the 
      joy of discovering cyclist-friendly cafes.
      I'm committed to maintaining and enhancing this app, making sure that it 
      remains accessible to fellow cyclists eager to share their favorite cafes!
      I built it as part of my programming journey, to further improve my web 
      development skills with python🐍</p>
